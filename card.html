			<p>Nicknamed the “sourmug,” the bulldog is a stocky dog that moves with a 
				rolling gait. It has a large head, folded ears, a short muzzle, a protruding lower jaw, 
				and loose skin that forms wrinkles on the head and face. Its short, fine coat is tan, 
				white, reddish brown, brindle, or piebald.</p>
